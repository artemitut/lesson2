        <h2 class="center" >What make a superhero?</h2>
        <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldnt. So in order to
            be a superhero,<strong> you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</strong>strong, and you need
            to.use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.
        </p>
        <p>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if i's
            1 good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a
            normal human being couldn't do, couldn't accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>
